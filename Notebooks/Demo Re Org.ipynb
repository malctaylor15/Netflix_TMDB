However, alchemy works on the theory of Equivalent Exchange -- for something to be created, something else of equal value must be sacrificed. When their mother dies, Edward decides to do the unthinkable -- bringing her back to life by breaking one of Alchemy's biggest taboos and performing Human Alchemy. Thinking they have nothing more to lose, he and Alphonse make their attempt -- but something goes horribly wrong. In the process, Alphonse loses his body and Edward loses his leg. Ed manages to save Al by attaching his spirit to a suit of armor, but at the cost of his arm and leg.\",\n",

However, alchemy works on the theory of Equivalent Exchange -- for something to be created, something else of equal value must be sacrificed. When their mother dies, Edward decides to do the unthinkable -- bringing her back to life by breaking one of Alchemy's biggest taboos and performing Human Alchemy. Thinking they have nothing more to lose, he and Alphonse make their attempt -- but something goes horribly wrong. In the process, Alphonse loses his body and Edward loses his leg. Ed manages to save Al by attaching his spirit to a suit of armor, but at the cost of his arm and leg.\",\n",
